      <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <p>
        With over a decade of combined hands-on customs brokerage experience, the team has worked
        across diverse industries, commodities, and regulatory environments. What began as individual
        expertise developed through years of field operations has evolved into a shared commitment:
        delivering precise, reliable, and fully compliant customs solutions for growing businesses.
      </p>

      <p>
        We have managed high-volume clearance operations, complex tariff classifications, regulatory audits,
        and time-sensitive shipments. Through each engagement, one principle has remained constant —
        details matter.
      </p>

      <h1>Our Approach</h1>
      <p>
        Customs clearance is not merely data entry — it is structured risk management.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every entry is handled with a compliance-first mindset. We verify classifications, assess
        regulatory exposure, anticipate inspection or PGA requirements, and communicate proactively
        with clarity and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our objective is straightforward: eliminate uncertainty before it becomes operational risk.
      </p>

      <hr class="sep" />

      <h1>Operating Principles</h1>
      <p>
        Accuracy before speed.<br>
        Compliance before convenience.<br>
        Transparency in communication.<br>
        Accountability in every submission.
      </p>

      <p>
        We do not believe in shortcuts. We believe in structured systems that support sustainable compliance.
      </p>

      <hr class="sep" />

      <h1>What Clients Can Expect</h1>
      <p>When working with us, clients can expect:</p>

      <ul style="margin-left:18px; color: var(--muted);">
        <li>Clear explanations, not vague responses</li>
        <li>Proactive updates, not reactive damage control</li>
        <li>Strategic guidance on HS classification and regulatory exposure</li>
        <li>Long-term compliance planning — not one-time transactions</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Our aim is to become a trusted partner — not merely a service provider.
      </p>
